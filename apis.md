description: 'With the API your app can authenticate users, identify user roles (student/teacher/admin),
  read announcements, gather scheduling data, push grades to the Chalkable gradebook,
  and so much more. View our documentation page to learn more about the Chalkable
  experience: how our app store works, how teachers and students will use your app
  within the context of Chalkable, and how our platform uses basic Javascript callback
  functions for integration.'
